# My PGP Inbox

Welcome to my inbox! Feel free to send me a secure and private message by opening an issue and encrypting your message with my public PGP key.

## [My Public Key](https://github.com/{USERNAME}.gpg)

Don't have a PGP key set up up? That's OK! It's super simple to set one up (five minutes or less) and once you do, not only can we have a totally secure private chat right out in the open, but you can also get that nice **VERIFIED** badge if you choose to sign your commits. Check out this [PGP quick-start guide](./GPG-GUIDE.md) to get started!
