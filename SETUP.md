# Setup

Thanks for using this template! Follow these steps to set up your encrypted inbox.

## 1. Use this template

Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repo to create your own copy.

## 2. Update the README

Edit `README.md` and replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username in the public key link:

```
https://github.com/USERNAME.gpg
```

## 3. Add your GPG key to GitHub

If you haven't already, follow the [GPG Guide](GPG-GUIDE.md) to create a key and add it to your GitHub account.

## 4. Enable GitHub Actions

The workflow that auto-closes non-encrypted issues should work automatically. To verify:

1. Go to your repo's **Actions** tab
2. If prompted, enable workflows

## 5. Delete this file

Once you're set up, delete `SETUP.md` from your repo—you won't need it anymore.
